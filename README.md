# YG0-Computation

## Description
This repository hosts the MATLAB implementation of the `G0Luminance` function, which is designed to compute the G0-referenced luminance for given chromaticity coordinates.

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB (R2021a or later recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox

### Functions
- G0Luminance: Main function to calculate the G0 luminance based on chromaticity coordinates.
- Other Functions: Include various support functions from the MCSL-tools, which are utilized for detailed color calculations and analysis.
